# Domiciano

Open source engine implementation for the abandonware graphic adventure "[Tito en la mina](http://www.abandonsocios.org/index.php?topic=10669.0)" by Micronet, year 2000. The original game seems to have no reference at all in Micronet's webpage.

This project is named "Domiciano" (Domitian) after the succesor of the roman emperor "Tito" (Titus), just a little reference.

## But... why?

Well... I loved the original game! It deserves to be playable in modern computers.

## Next major goals

- [ ] Extract all the sprites from the game's original files.
- [ ] Extract all the sounds from the game's original files.

## Building from source

Nowadays, this project is in an early research stage, so, there's no source at all, hence, nothing to build.

## Running

Obviously, there's nothing to run right now. However, it will be required to have an original copy of the game CD-ROM, from which the engine will extract all the game assets.

## Contributing

In this first stage of the development, every information about the .dxr files generated by the old Macromedia Director is welcomed.

## Releases

Pre-release binaries will be published everytime a major goal is achieved.
